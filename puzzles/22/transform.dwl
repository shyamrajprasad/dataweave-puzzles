/*
Divide the elements of an array into smaller subarrays, each with a sum that is below 100.
Expected output
When we enumerate all natural numbers under 10 that are divisible by either 3 or 5, we obtain 3, 5, 6, and 9. The total sum of these multiples amounts to 23.

Determine the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
